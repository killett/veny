"""Resolve an import name to the pip package name that provides it.

veny needs to know that ``import cv2`` means ``pip install opencv-python``.
That mapping is a property of PyPI, not of veny, so this module derives it
from evidence -- the target interpreter's installed distributions, PyPI wheel
metadata, a small curated seed, a user override file, and a cache of results
that were verified by actually installing and importing them. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-module-alias-resolver-design.md.

This module deliberately imports nothing from veny or univ_defs, so it can be
tested on its own and so the dependency direction stays one-way. It never
installs anything: it produces ranked candidates and veny verifies them.
